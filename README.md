# XOR Neural Network

This project demonstrates a simple neural network implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras to learn the XOR (exclusive OR) function.

## Overview

The XOR function is a classic problem in the field of neural networks because it is not linearly separable.  This project uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with hidden layers to learn the non-linear relationships required to accurately predict XOR outputs.

## Code Description

*   `xor_network.py`: The main Python script containing the neural network definition, training, and evaluation code.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   TensorFlow 2.x
*   Keras
*   NumPy

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
